# üìä Task 2 - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset  

**üë©‚Äçüíª Internship:** SkillCraft Technology  
**‚úçÔ∏è Author:** Piyush Patil  
**üìÇ Task:** 2 ‚Äì Data Cleaning & EDA  

---

## üìù **Objective**
The aim of this task was to:
- Perform **data cleaning** (handle missing values, convert data types, remove duplicates)
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to extract meaningful insights
- Visualize key patterns and relationships in the Titanic dataset

---

## üßπ **Data Cleaning Steps**
‚úî Converted `age` & `fare` columns to numeric format  
‚úî Filled missing values:
  - **Age** ‚Üí Median  
  - **Fare** ‚Üí Median  
  - **Embarked** ‚Üí Mode (most frequent value)  
‚úî Removed duplicate rows (if any)  
‚úî Exported cleaned dataset ‚Üí **`cleaned_titanic.csv`**

## üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis**

### üî¢ Survival Count
Shows distribution of passengers who survived vs. those who did not.

### üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Survival by Gender
Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.

---

### üìà Age Distribution
Majority of passengers were between **20-40 years old**.

---

### üõ≥ Survival by Passenger Class
1st class passengers had a much higher chance of survival compared to 2nd and 3rd class.

### üî• Correlation Heatmap
Fare and class are strongly correlated with survival probability.
